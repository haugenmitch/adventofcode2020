# Advent of Code 2020

Solutions to the Advent of Code 2020 Challenge in Rust

## Day 01

### Notes

This is my first (non-trivial) Rust program, and it sure looks like it. I haven't taken the time to go through and read the Rust documentation thoroughly, so this was thrown together with lots of borrowed code from Stack Overflow and the Rust forums.

#### Part 1

It reads in the ints from the file, sorts them, and loops to find if the complement of a number N (2020 - N) exists in the integer vector. If a pair is found, they are printed, as well as their product.

#### Part 2

I essentially did the same thing as part 1, except I used a nested for-loop.

### Solution, Part 1

`757 x 1263 = 956091`

### Solution, Part 2

`1568 x 211 x 241 = 79734368`
