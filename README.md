# Advent of Code 2020

Solutions to the Advent of Code 2020 Challenge in Rust

---

## Day 01

### Notes

This is my first (non-trivial) Rust program, and it sure looks like it. I haven't taken the time to go through and read the Rust documentation thoroughly, so this was thrown together with lots of borrowed code from Stack Overflow and the Rust forums.

#### Part 1

It reads in the ints from the file, sorts them, and loops to find if the complement of a number N (2020 - N) exists in the integer vector. If a pair is found, they are printed, as well as their product.

#### Part 2

I essentially did the same thing as part 1, except I used a nested for-loop.

### Solution, Part 1

`757 x 1263 = 956091`

### Solution, Part 2

`1568 x 211 x 241 = 79734368`

## Day 02

### Notes

I did a lot of cleanup of the program. Last year, I made individual Python programs/scripts for every day of the challenge. This year I'd like to go for a bit cleaner of a solution that allows for a little more code reuse. With that in mind, I added a system for selecting the day and part of the challenge with command line arguments. Each new day will be done in a separate module. The challenge for day 2 wasn't very hard. It was more about learning the basics of Rust. I'm getting there, but it definitely has a steep learning curve and likes to throw your errors at you. It's quite different from 2019's Python solutions.

### Solution, Part 1
